# A food delivery web application.
This was the first time creating something of this scale for all of us in the group. MVP's were all met and it was beautiful.
Made using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript with the help of Bootstrap! Used Google Firebase Firestore real-time database for storage and user authentication.
The project was originally done on our campus's gitlab server, so it does not show all of our activity during development.

The application allows for a user to create an account as a restaurant owner, driver, or customer.

## Restaurant Owner:
- Can CRUD restauraunts
- Can CRUD menus for each restaurant
- Can CRUD food items for each menu
-Restaurants, Menus, and Food each have attributes that allow the customer to search and sort to find their desired taste.

## Driver:
- Can see orders in their area
- Can choose to accept or deny the order
- Can update the status of the order once accepted


## Customer:
- Can add addresses and payment methods
- Can place orders at multiple restaurants
- Can see when the status of the order changes
